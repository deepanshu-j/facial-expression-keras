Facial Expression Recognition model using Convolutional Neural Network, <br/>
- Accuracy - 54% (altough the dataset was pretty inaccurate) 
- Model consists of 3 blocks - each with a Conv layer, followed by a Pooling layer followed by a batch Normalization layer, <br/>
followed by a fully connected Dense layer and softmax at last.
